            This part of the website will delve into what to expect from 
            these juggernauts and the best way to deal with them.

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><img src="BossArt/General_wiki.webp" class="d-black w-100" alt="General"></th>
                    <th><div>"Locked in a nightmare slumber, he is tortured by failures both real, and imagined."
                        The General is an endurance test, a stress hazard, and a control fight all in one. 
                        His large health pool will allow him to put significant stress on your heroes 
                        before he goes down, though he doesn't have the greatest ability to kill heroes. 
                        Unsettling Whispers can be dealt with by putting taunt on heroes like Leper, 
                        Man At Arms, or Hellion, all of whom have Taunt and Stress healing moves. 
                        The Waking Dead is his main way of disrupting a formation, depending on who he 
                        targets and how much you're willing to let them get hurt. Nightmare is almost 
                        never seen unless the boss succeeds in disrupting you enough to prevent you from 
                        hitting the root. If you are hit by Nightmare, be ready to heal and use the removed 
                        roots to recover or clear the fight before the General can follow up on his advantage.
                    </div>
                    <div class="seperate">Alongside the General is the Taproot, an invulnerable fixture to Rank 4 that starts the fight 
                        by dropping vines on the Heroes. Afterwards, at the start of every round it will drop 2 vines 
                        onto 2 different heroes. Hitting the root will cause it to retract 1 vine from a random hero, 
                        so 2 hits on the Taproot will remove all vines added that round. However, if it gets hit twice
                        since the beginning of the fight or the last Waking Dead, it will use Soil Stirs to target 2 
                        ranks for Waking Dead. Because of this, care needs to be taken on when you hit the Taproot as 
                        to prevent runaway vine generation and minimize the amount of Waking Dead's that the General 
                        will use.</div>
                    </th>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
                <th><img src="BossArt/Harvest_wiki_darker.webp" class="d-black w-100" alt="Harvest Child"></th>
                <th>"Born to a corpulent, half-eaten mother, the child is a ravenous avatar of degeneracy!"
                    A lot of the damage sustained during this fight will likely be from Bleed and Blight 
                    so it is recommended to bring some method of healing these afflictions, 
                    such as Plague Doctor's "Battlefield Medicine". Additionally, Bleed and Blight 
                    resistance buffs can be highly advantageous in mitigating damage taken.
                    As a Lair boss, the Harvest Child is unable to be Ordained or receive a Battle modifier,
                    although as the player is required to go through two fights before reaching the Harvest 
                    Child, they may be unprepared for the boss fight if they had exceptionally difficult 
                    combats beforehand. Decide if your party is in a fit state to fight the Harvest Child 
                    carefully before advancing on from the second wave to initiate the boss fight.
                    The Harvest Child is a fight which can easily spiral out of control should the player 
                    be unable to mitigate hunger or control enemy positioning, but by employing the counter 
                    strategies located in this guide, can be simplified immensely.

                <th><div>"They must be made to see that their monstrous god is mortal." It's important that everyone in your party, even the support characters, is capable of dealing at least some damage during this fight. If your primary damage-dealer gets taken underwater, it will take a long time to free them if the rest of the party can't make up the difference. Try to destroy the hand as quickly as possible using heavy melee attackers like the Leper or Hellion, while the rest of the party manages buffs and debuffs or makes ranged attacks against the head.</div>

                <div class="seperate">From a mechanical, technical, and strategic view, the Leviathan's attack patterns are shockingly simple to understand and the only variance in fights would, theoretically, just be who it targets. Leviathan has 2 "Phases" it switches between; Prepare phase and Attack phase. It starts the fight in Prepare phase, in which it will always start the round with Breath of the Sea, then use its normal action to use Eyes of the Storm, and ending the round with Deep Rising. Once the round starts and it has its hand out, it will switch to Attack phase, using its only action to use Tidal Surge on the party. Once the hand is defeated it will switch back to Prepare phase, repeating this cycle until either you die or it dies.</div>

                <th><img src="BossArt/Lib_wiki.webp" class="d-black w-100" alt="Librarian"></th>
                <th><div>"He teeters madly upon his ladder, reveling in the fiery destruction of human accomplishment!"
                The Librarian is a fight that starts slow and ends quickly. Book Stacks serve as an "enrage timer" of sorts, meaning the player ideally ends the encounter as quickly as possible before the Librarian reaches rank 1. On average, it takes the Librarian 6 or 7 turns to reach the front because of the random HP pools for the book stacks.

                The player will need a team that can consistently damage every rank as the Librarian marches slowly forward. Since the Librarian is immune to Move 
                it may be difficult for heroes with low reach to attack him. However, Book Stacks are not immune to Move 
                and it is possible to push Book Stacks behind the Librarian in order to reach him. The player may also destroy the Book Stacks, but this is highly dangerous as it reduces the amount of time before the Librarian ignites himself. </div>

                <div class="seperate">Many Combat Items are useful against the Librarian. Like many enemies in The Sprawl, the Librarian has relatively low health, instead relying heavily on dodge and  blind for defense. By using any offensive combat item, one can consume both a  dodge and blind token as a free action, then proceed to hit the Librarian normally. Defensively, Ablative Powders and Burn Salve can help mitigate his damage output and Milk-Soaked Linen and Holy Water can remove the blind Blind Tokens.

                It's important to check if Categorize will result in a detrimental shuffle for your party, and if so, to consider countermeasures accordingly.</div></th>
