                    Bleed is the only type of damage over time inflicted by Cadavers. Likewise they are resistant to Bleed, somewhat resistant to blight, and weak to burn.
                    Drummers boost their allies by granting them order tokens as well as making them practically immune to move. Killing the Drummer is a high priority.
                    bishop With enough benedictions Bishops can resurrect dead allies, making them high-priority targets.</div>

                Fanatics have relatively low health compared to other factions. Instead, they tend to apply tokens like blind and dodge to disrupt heroes' attacks.
                Immolatists and Her Ladyship deal high Burn damage, stress damage, can Ignite other Fanatics, and can consume corpses to heal other Fanatics. She is therefore your highest priority.
                Whippers, when Ignited, can use Infernal Taskmaster, a devastating party-wide AoE that does HP damage, stress damage and Burn. Killing this enemy in round 1 is important so he doesn't ignite.</div>

                Pit Fighters will start with relatively weak attacks, but upon casting Accelerant will gain speed and damage at the beginning of every round.
                Shamans make their allies harder to hit by blinding heroes or granting dodge to their allies.
                Flayers can generate constant Riposte and Dodge tokens, making them very dangerous, but have relatively low base Icon HP.</div></th>
