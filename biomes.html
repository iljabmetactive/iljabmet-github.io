            This is where we will explain to you the diffrences between each biome and 
            what to expect to find in each one in terms of regione specific trinkets and events

        <table>
            
            
            <tr>
                <th><img src="BiomeImages/Biome_choice_city.webp" class="d-black w-100" alt="Sprawl"></th>
                <th>"Behold the great cities of man - ruined and aflame.". Being one of the first biomes available to the player, 
                    it is one of the best at introducing the player to the perils and challenges that are to be 
                    expected later on. With the city aflame by the citizens that went mad, the player can expect 
                    to be introduced to the fire DOT (damage over time) mechanic that serves a similar role as bleed 
                    and blight. Adding to the deadly arsenal of this areas foes and to a potentially to yours. 
                    However , this flaming wreck can offer one of the most powerful trinkets in the game to fast 
                    characters and those that use fire DOT’s such as runaway or Plague doctor later on in your 
                    progression. It also host one of the most powerful trophy rewards that is universally useful, 
                    granting burn DOT on critical hits at the cost of occasionally combusting yourself at the start 
                    of combat. With a caveat like that and critical hits being easier to come by then in the previous
                    game, it is worth a try to get an early start in your future playthroughs.</th>
            </tr>

            <th><img src="BiomeImages/Biome_choice_forest.webp" class="d-black w-100" alt="Tangle"></th>
                <th>"War rewards only resignation.".The second available biome to the player on contrast in my 
                    opinion is one the more gruesome introductions. Having to navigate the viny undergrowth’s of 
                    the forest and forgotten trenches, This abandoned battlefield is a place which will test your 
                    parties composition. For while you could get away to an extent with having a bad team in the 
                    sprawl, here the enemies will take advantage of your weaknesses and use their superior 
                    positioning to its fullest. Which is why for a starting region it is a swift wake up call to 
                    those playing to learn quickly and adapt to make it through the game. Besides that, this lands 
                    treasures focus more on getting hit to force hindrances on the attacker, and slower characters 
                    utilizing from extra turns when hit. Thus, if you run a team that has bulky yet slow characters 
                    that can taunt the enemies or guard vulnerable allies, then this region will be a treat for them. </th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <th><img src="BiomeImages/Biome_choice_coast.webp" class="d-black w-100" alt="Cove"></th>
                <th>"Propriety floats listless on the tide, brined in noxious degradation.".After completing the 
                    first chapter you get access to other biomes of the game, one of which being the coast. 
                    Before being a peaceful fishing hamlet, now turned to a place of worship and transformations by 
                    the local fishermen. Desperately searching for a way to save themselves from the chaos of the 
                    world. With this comes one of the only biome specific mechanic called “the fog”. This comes into 
                    effect periodically during combat, where all your heroes get either hindered or stressed out. 
                    However after the turn when the fog enters ends, it disappears which has a chance to reduce 
                    someone’s stress. With that in mind What it holds in treasures is more specific, as this region 
                    specializes in resisting movement and bleed whilst amplifying bleed DOTs. Giving bleed builds 
                    like highwaymen or hellion some powerful options, whilst giving more resistance to party members 
                    in need of it. </th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <th><img src="BiomeImages/Biome_choice_farm.webp" class="d-black w-100" alt="Forteor"></th>
                <th>"The rancid crop grows unchecked and abhorrent..." This rotting farmstead which was once a 
                    land of bountiful crop and livestock, starting becoming more corrupt as the events of the 
                    story transpired. Running out of food and starving, the lords and peasants had no choice
                     but to try these yields for some sense of sustenance, but this action would prove to 
                     change these people figuratively and literally. For now they walk the fields as monsters 
                     of endless hunger and tend to the sick and rotting plants that grow here, worshipping the 
                     child of the harvest that now lingers among them. Now besides that there is not much to say
                      about them aside from the treasures that can be found here. From which this location 
                      specializes in blight effects and increasing health gain. Because of this it makes for a 
                      great place for characters who specialize in blight damage like plague doctor, 
                      grave robber and even flagellant.</th>
            </tr>



            <tr>
                <th><img src="BiomeImages/Biome_choice_cave.webp" class="d-black w-100" alt="Sluice"></th>
                <th>"Tread carefully and quickly. This is swine country." After a few runs you will get the 
                    travel through the dense caverns of the sluice to face the beast bellow in promise of treasure. 
                    However there will be no baubles down here, for this is one biome which has a distinct lack of 
                    baubles. This can be problematic since that is the currency that allows you to buy trinkets on 
                    your journey. But it makes up for it with the opportunity to get a larger sum of treasury then 
                    normal. Allowing you to buy way more food, benefits and buffs then normal. So overall it is 
                    most of time worth going there over all the other locations just for the sheer amount of 
                    treasure you can get. As for trinkets they are more lackluster then most others, focusing on 
                    having low light in combat to get the full benefits of the trinket. This could be useful if 
                    further in your playthrough you chose to start with flames that reduce your total flame. But 
                    most of the time it is not worth the trouble. </th>

                    and the usual end of your playthrough of an act. This place serves to test the player for their
                    skill, composition and knowledge of the mechanics. However, before the boss fight there is 
                    always a cultist encounter to wear you down. These encounter increase in difficulty and amount 
                    with each future act, increasing from 1 in the first act to 4 in the last. Other then that 
                    there will be no rewards or trinkets given for these fight since you will not put them to use 
                    after anyway.  </th>
